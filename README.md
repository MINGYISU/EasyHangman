# EasyHangman
This is a C program that behaves similarly to a hangman game. There is no hangman figure, but I added some other interesting features, including multiple-players, scoreboard system and so on. When the game starts, you have to enter the number of participants, and then enter a character string (a word or a sentence that you are about to guess). Please note that cases do not matter, but there is a restriction on the length, which is no longer than 50 words, and the string should only include printable characters (except the special character * , which is not allowed to have because it will be used to represent the board). All the players take turns to guess the word. You can earn 10 bonus scores for each correctly guessed character. Everyone only has 5 chances of wrong guesses and will be eliminated if they have ran out all the chances. If all the players are eliminated, the game is over and there won't be a winner. If someone has successfully solves the word, the player with the highest scores will be the champion, and there will be a scoreboard that shows the rankings. Finally you can choose play again or quit. Thanks for playing. Have fun!
