# EasyHangman
This is an enhanced C program inspired by the classic hangman game. While it doesn't feature a traditional hangman figure, it incorporates various captivating elements. The program supports multiple players and includes a scoreboard system. Upon launching the game, you will be prompted to enter the number of participants. Subsequently, you should input a character string, which can be a word or a sentence to be guessed.

It's important to note that letter cases are disregarded, and the string length must not exceed 50 words. Additionally, the string should only consist of printable characters, excluding the special character '*', as it is reserved for representing the game board.

In this game, each player takes turns guessing the word. Successfully guessing a character awards 10 bonus points. However, players have a maximum of 5 incorrect guesses before being eliminated from the game. If all players are eliminated, the game ends without a winner. On the other hand, if a player manages to solve the word, the participant with the highest score becomes the champion. A scoreboard will be displayed, showcasing the rankings.

Finally, after a game concludes, you have the option to play again or quit. Thank you for playing, and enjoy the game!
